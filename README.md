Rage maze is a love project that instills resiliency into the player.This maze was made to test the very limit of someones patience. A large issue that has evolved with the advancement of technology is the lack of resiliency we as humans have. It seems like now adays we quit when things become slightly dificult or try to find a easy way out with technology.Without resistance there is no growth. Will you continue to grow through the pain that is Rage Maze or will you just give up?

The project is run by setting up a maze using a large grid of zeros and ones from a text file. The player can be moved using the track pad of the laptop.If the player touches the maze walls, collision of both of the walls and the players rect(the hit box)will cause the player Weenie and the goal ketchup to reset their original positions.When Weenie fnally gets close enough to the goal ketchup, Ketchup will teleport. This happens three times. At all times with the help of pygame.mixer, the phrase "loud noises !" is played constantly. Upon reset pygame.mixer will play "sucks to suck".When Weenie finally collides with ketchup, the player will be unable to move and the statement "took you long enough " will post on the screen.

Start by downloading pygame and sys and importing them. Please use visual studio code or pycharm

To play the game you must use the mouse pad on the computer to progress through
the game and try to reach the goal in the maze.
